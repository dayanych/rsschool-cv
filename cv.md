## Dayana Shakenova

### Contacts
telegram: @lfzyf
discord: slowpoke #8833

### Information about yourself
I work, I study, I dream of earning millions, while doing nothing (that's why I'm learning programming). Strengths - do nothing and live independently in 20 years, and also punctuality. Work experience: study for 2 years in _sharaga_, realize the uselessness of a diploma

### Skills
love programming, but don't do it (does it count?)

### Code examples
I don't even want to embarrass myself and throw off my examples, **but** to show off that I read the markdown documentation, I'll add a simple code here:
```javascript
const sentence = 'Hello, World!'
console.log(sentence)
```

### Experience
study, study and study again (and this cv.md)

### Education
as written above, incomplete higher education, some courses in python and JavaScript

### English proficiency
do this task with the help of google translate
