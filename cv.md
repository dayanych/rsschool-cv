1. **Skills:** love programming, but don't do it (does it count?)
1. **Code examples:** I don't even want to embarrass myself and throw off my examples, **but** to show off that I read the markdown documentation, I'll add a simple code here:
    ```javascript
    const sentence = 'Hello, World!'
    console.log(sentence)
    ```
1. **Experience:** study, study and study again (and this cv.md)
